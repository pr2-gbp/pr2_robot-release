Description: The PR2 is equipped with a texture projector that can be used to project a texture onto featureless surfaces, allowing their three-dimensional structure to be determined using stereoscopy.
 The projector operates in a pulsed mode, producing brief (2ms) pulses of light. Cameras that want to see the texture must expose during the projector pulse; other cameras should be expose while the projector is off. This package contains the pr2_projector_synchronizer node. Based on its dynamically reconfigurable parameters, this node controls the projector pulsing, and sets up triggering of the WGE100 cameras.
