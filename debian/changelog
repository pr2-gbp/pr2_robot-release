ros-melodic-pr2-bringup (1.6.31-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * pr2_bringup: test launch files (#255 <https://github.com/pr2/pr2_robot/issues/255>)
    
      * Disable because pr2.launch needs to resolve c1/c2 hostname
    
  * rebased version of https://github.com/PR2/pr2_robot/pull/256 (#263 <https://github.com/pr2/pr2_robot/issues/263>)
    
      * Adapt monitoring to upgraded PR2s:
        - no more IPMI
        - new number of CPU cores
        - re-add monitoring of c2
    
  * calibrate_pr2: intercept and print exception (#248 <https://github.com/pr2/pr2_robot/issues/248>)
    * This was silently ignored before.
    * White space cleanup
  * Param names changed between urg_node and hokuyo_node (#257 <https://github.com/pr2/pr2_robot/issues/257>)
    
      * The new urg_node package is used for the laser scanners in kinetic, but the parameter names are still the one of the hokuyo_node package.
